# MyArduinoSerialInterface
Here are my attempts at a serial interface for a microcontroller. I've always wanted to create something like this so I can configure and change projects without needing to re-flash them.

## Version 1
A very simple CLI interface. If the character `b` is sent over the serial connection, it will toggle the LED.
The CLI is blocking, and nothing else is able to run on the controller except for the CLI.

```
> bbbbb
ON
OFF
ON
OFF
ON
```

## Version 2
Another simple CLI similar to version one, but this time the character `0` will turn off the LED, and the character `1` will turn it on.
The CLI is still blocking, and doesn't allow anything else to run on the controller except for the CLI.

```
> 1001110
ON
OFF
OFF
ON
ON
ON
OFF
> 101
ON
OFF
ON
```

## Version 3
Same as before, sending 0 and 1 characters over serial, but is now non-blocking and allows the controller to work on other activities alongside the serial interface.
To demonstrate, it will output `millis` every 1000 milliseconds alongside the serial interface.

```
1000
2000
> 00101
OFF
OFF
ON
OFF
ON
3000
4000
5000
> 01
OFF
ON
6000
7000
```

## Version 4
Now uses commands instead of just single characters. Each command is on a single line. The commands are also not case-sensitive, so you can go crazy on the SHIFT key and the commands will still work

OK = prints the message `I am OK`.
SET = set the value of the variable to something (e.g. `set abc123`).
GET = prints the value of the variable e.g. `That value: abc123`.
Unknown commands get the mesage `Unknown command`.

```
1000
2000
> Ok
I am OK
3000
4000
> set Test Value
5000
> GeT
That value: Test Value
6000
> BadCommand
Unknown command
7000
```

## Version 5
A relatively complete serial interface, passing CLI details between functions, each command is its own function instead of everything bunched into a single function.
I got rid of the `millis` being outputted to the console, I've proven that that part works just fine.

Commands control the onboard LED.
OK = prints the message `I am OK`.
SET = Sets the LED. `SET ON` turns it on, `SET OFF` turns it off.

```
> OK
I am OK
> BadCommand
Unknown command
> set on
LED is ON
> sEt oN
LED is ON
> set off
LED is OFF
> set asdasdads

> set ddddddd

```

## Version 6
The big one.

The CLI interface is built out into a object oriented library, and broken out into separate files instead of one massive file.

```
START
ADD CMD 0 OK
ADD CMD 1 SET
ADD CMD 2 MILLIS
> OK
I am OK
> MilLis
3165
> set asdadsasd
UNK LED CMD
> set on
LED ON
> set off
LED is OFF
> set off
LED is OFF
> asdasdasd
UNK CMD
> help
--- HELP ---
0 OK
1 SET
2 MILLIS
```

Commands are defined on startup. Each command is a `MyCliCmd` object, and uses callback functions to handle the incoming command. The command buffer is a `MyCliBuffer` object with helper functions for reading the buffer.

```cpp
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("START");

  // Setup the CLI
  cli = MyCli();

  // Explicitly construct the CMD objects, then pass them through.
  MyCliCmd cmdOk = MyCliCmd("ok", &cliOK);
  cli.addCmd(&cmdOk);
  
  MyCliCmd cmdSet = MyCliCmd("set", &cliSetLed);
  cli.addCmd(&cmdSet);

  MyCliCmd cmdMillis = MyCliCmd("millis", &cliMillis);
  cli.addCmd(&cmdMillis);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  cli.think();
}
```

Here's an example CLI command for setting the onboard LED.

```cpp
void cliSetLed(char *cmd, MyCliBuffer& buffer) {
  char* cliPart = buffer.readTo(CLI_DELIM_SPACE_EOL);
  strupr(cliPart); // Make uppercase, don't care about case sensitivity
  
  if (!strcmp(cliPart, ledValOn)) {
    setLed(true);
  } else if (!strcmp(cliPart, ledValOff)) {
    setLed(false);
  } else {
    Serial.println("UNK LED CMD");
  }
}
```
